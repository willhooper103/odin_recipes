    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup plain bread crumbs​</li>
        <li>½ cup milk​</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil​</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced​</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef​</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>2 eggs​</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese​</li>
        <li>¼ bunch fresh parsley, chopped​</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed​</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt​</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning​</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes​</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with foil and lightly coat it with cooking spray.​</li>
        <li>Soak the bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for about 20 minutes.​</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and continue cooking until the onion is very tender, about 15 more minutes.​</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, gently mix the ground beef and pork together. Add the cooked onions, soaked bread crumbs, eggs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes. Combine the mixture using a rubber spatula until everything is well blended. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.​</li>
        <li>Form the mixture into balls about 1 ½ inches in diameter and arrange them in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.​</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the meatballs are browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.​</li>
        <li>Serve the meatballs hot and enjoy!​</li>
    </ol>
